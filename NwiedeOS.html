<CENTER>This is an X86 based linux flavor that I have created. I compiled the repositories, and then converted it to a bootable ISO via: Suse Studio. Suse Studio is an online<BR></CENTER>
<CENTER>based linux distro creator. Though it is easy to use I would not recommend it for creating your own distro due to lack of compatibility. I am currently working to make the OS into a <BR></CENTER>
<CENTER>smaller format that is uncompressed and not in a ISO so that I could later push it to github in an editing friendly format. The OS can be installed fresh as a normal OS, or through virtualbox.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I personally recommend Virtual Box over VMWare, due to some graphical problems that I encountered using VMWare. The download link for both the OS and Virtual Box can be found below.</CENTER><HR>
